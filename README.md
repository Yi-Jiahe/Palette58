# Palette 58

My first (to-be) split ergonomic keyboard.

4x6 column staggered board with 5 key thumb cluster utilizing low profile switches.

The Palette 58 is meant to be an introductory keyboard, heavily inspired by the Sofle.

It includes a number row and additional outer pinky column to support a wider range of layouts to allow for experimentation.

Compared to the Sofle, it features a more aggressive pinky stagger and no additional flex key.

No LEDs because of the added complexity and cost.
